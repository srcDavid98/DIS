# Note on trampolining
(optional, advanced, reading, may be skipped)
You may notice that the methods in MainView and in CustomerController have the return type Trampoline<Void> and
that they return something like Trampoline.more(() -> <<<method call>>>) instead of a normal value or just the method call.
This called 'trampolining' and is used to avoid uncontrollable stack growth. What happens is that the method call, to the view or controller method, is deferred
and handled after the return, thus avoiding the stack growing. You do not have to worry about this, just make sure all view and controller
methods return Trampoline<Void> and that they return Trampoline.more(() -> <<<call to view/controller method where the program continues>>>).
